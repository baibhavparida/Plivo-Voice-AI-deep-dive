### Core Technologies Explained

**Speech-to-Text (STT)** converts spoken language into machine-readable text. Modern STT systems achieve near-human accuracy on clean audio and can process speech in real-time with sub-300ms latency.

**Text-to-Speech (TTS)** generates natural-sounding speech from text. Neural TTS models now produce voices virtually indistinguishable from human speech, with emotional expressiveness and prosodic control.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** provide the conversational intelligence that makes voice AI agents capable of understanding context, maintaining multi-turn conversations, and generating relevant responses.

**Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** extracts meaning from text, including intent recognition, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis.

**Dialog Management** orchestrates the conversation flow, managing state, handling errors, and ensuring coherent multi-turn interactions.
