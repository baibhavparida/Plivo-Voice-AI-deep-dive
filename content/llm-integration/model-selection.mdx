# LLM Model Selection for Voice AI

The choice of Large Language Model fundamentally determines both the quality ceiling and latency floor of voice agents. Research indicates that the LLM accounts for approximately 71% of end-to-end voice agent latency, making model selection one of the most critical decisions in voice AI architecture.

## The Latency Equation

Understanding the latency breakdown is essential for model selection:

```
Total Latency = T_STT + T_LLM + T_TTS + T_Network
```

Typical values:
- **T_STT**: 150-300ms (Speech recognition)
- **T_LLM**: 300-1500ms (LLM inference) - the dominant factor
- **T_TTS**: 100-300ms (Speech synthesis)
- **T_Network**: 50-150ms (Round-trip time)

**Critical Threshold**: Human conversation operates within a 300-500ms response window. Delays beyond 500ms feel unnatural, and delays beyond 1.5 seconds cause rapid experience degradation.

## Cost Analysis Per Minute of Conversation

Assuming average voice conversation:
- 30 words spoken per turn (user)
- 50 words generated per turn (agent)
- 6 turns per minute
- ~40 input tokens, ~65 output tokens per turn
- 240 input tokens, 390 output tokens per minute

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Total/Min | Cost/Hour |
|-------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.000036 | $0.000234 | $0.00027 | $0.016 |
| Claude 3 Haiku | $0.000060 | $0.000488 | $0.00055 | $0.033 |
| Gemini Flash | $0.000036 | $0.001365 | $0.00140 | $0.084 |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $0.000192 | $0.001560 | $0.00175 | $0.105 |

## Key Metrics for Voice Applications

### Time to First Token (TTFT)

The latency from request submission to receiving the first generated token. TTFT determines when TTS can begin streaming audio - lower TTFT equals faster perceived response.

**Target**: TTFT of 500ms or less is generally acceptable for voice AI.

### Tokens Per Second (TPS)

The rate at which tokens are generated after the first token. Higher TPS enables longer responses without latency penalty.

### Context Window

While large context windows exist (up to 1M tokens), voice agents typically benefit more from efficient summarization than from using maximum context, due to latency implications.
