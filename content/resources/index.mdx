## Calculation Formulas

### Word Error Rate (WER)

```
WER = (Substitutions + Deletions + Insertions) / Total Words in Reference
```

Lower is better. Industry standard for good STT is WER < 10%.

### Mean Opinion Score (MOS)

Scale from 1-5:
- 5: Excellent (indistinguishable from human)
- 4: Good (minor imperfections)
- 3: Fair (noticeable artifacts)
- 2: Poor (difficult to understand)
- 1: Bad (unacceptable)

### Latency Budget

```
Total Latency = Network (in) + STT + LLM + TTS + Network (out) + Buffer
```

Target: < 500ms for natural conversation feel.

### Cost Per Call

```
Cost = STT Cost + LLM Cost + TTS Cost + Telephony Cost + Infrastructure Cost
```

Typical range: $0.05 - $0.50 per minute depending on providers.
