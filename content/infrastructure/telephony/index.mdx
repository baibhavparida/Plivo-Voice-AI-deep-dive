# Telephony

Telephony infrastructure connects your voice AI to the phone networks and communication channels where users interact. Whether through traditional phone calls, WebRTC in browsers, or SIP-based VoIP, telephony is how voice reaches your AI.

## Why Telephony Matters

Most enterprise voice AI deployments involve phone integration:

- **Customer Service**: Inbound calls to contact centers
- **Outbound Campaigns**: Sales and notification calls
- **IVR Replacement**: Modernizing legacy phone systems
- **Omnichannel**: Consistent experience across channels

## Topics in This Section

### [SIP Protocol](/topics/infrastructure/telephony/sip-protocol)
Session Initiation Protocol for establishing and managing voice calls. The foundation of VoIP communication.

### [WebRTC](/topics/infrastructure/telephony/webrtc)
Web Real-Time Communication for browser-based voice applications. Enable voice AI directly in web applications.

### [PSTN Integration](/topics/infrastructure/telephony/pstn-integration)
Connecting voice AI to traditional phone networks via PSTN gateways and SIP trunking.

### [Call Routing](/topics/infrastructure/telephony/call-routing)
Intelligent call routing, IVR integration, and call transfer mechanisms. Direct calls to the right destination.

## Communication Channels

| Channel | Latency | Quality | Use Case |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| **WebRTC** | Lowest | High | Web/mobile apps |
| **SIP/VoIP** | Low | High | Enterprise phone systems |
| **PSTN** | Medium | Variable | Traditional phone calls |
| **Mobile** | Variable | Variable | Cellular networks |

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **SIP** | Protocol for initiating, maintaining, and terminating calls |
| **RTP** | Real-time Transport Protocol for streaming audio |
| **SRTP** | Secure RTP with encryption |
| **Codec** | Audio compression format (G.711, Opus, etc.) |
| **SIP Trunk** | Connection between your system and PSTN |

## Architecture Patterns

### Cloud-Based Voice AI
```
PSTN → SIP Trunk Provider → Voice AI Platform → Your Application
```

### On-Premise Integration
```
PBX → SIP → Media Server → Voice AI → Business Logic
```

## Getting Started

Start with [SIP Protocol](/topics/infrastructure/telephony/sip-protocol) to understand the foundation of voice communication, then explore [WebRTC](/topics/infrastructure/telephony/webrtc) for browser-based applications or [PSTN Integration](/topics/infrastructure/telephony/pstn-integration) for phone network connectivity.
