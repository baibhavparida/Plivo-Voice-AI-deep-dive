# Streaming Infrastructure

Real-time streaming is the backbone of responsive voice AI systems. Unlike batch processing, streaming enables continuous, bidirectional audio flow that makes conversations feel natural and immediate.

## Why Streaming Matters

Voice conversations require real-time processing:

- **Low Latency**: Users expect responses within hundreds of milliseconds
- **Bidirectional**: Both parties can speak and listen simultaneously
- **Continuous**: Audio flows constantly, not in discrete chunks
- **Interruption**: Users should be able to interrupt the AI mid-response

## Topics in This Section

### [Streaming Overview](/topics/infrastructure/streaming/overview)
Introduction to real-time streaming concepts, protocols, and architecture patterns for voice AI systems.

### [WebSocket Protocols](/topics/infrastructure/streaming/websocket-protocols)
WebSocket-based streaming for bidirectional real-time audio communication. The most common approach for web-based voice AI.

### [gRPC Streaming](/topics/infrastructure/streaming/grpc-streaming)
gRPC streaming for high-performance voice AI service communication. Efficient binary protocols for server-to-server integration.

### [Buffer Management](/topics/infrastructure/streaming/buffer-management)
Audio buffer management strategies for smooth playback and minimal latency. Balance between latency and audio quality.

### [Latency Optimization](/topics/infrastructure/streaming/latency-optimization)
Techniques for minimizing end-to-end latency in voice AI systems. Every millisecond counts in conversational AI.

## Streaming Protocols Comparison

| Protocol | Best For | Latency | Complexity |
|----------|----------|---------|------------|
| **WebSocket** | Web applications | Low | Low |
| **gRPC** | Service-to-service | Very Low | Medium |
| **WebRTC** | P2P, browser-to-browser | Lowest | High |
| **HTTP/2 SSE** | Unidirectional streaming | Medium | Low |

## Key Latency Targets

| Metric | Excellent | Good | Acceptable |
|--------|-----------|------|------------|
| **Time-to-First-Audio** | &lt;250ms | 250-400ms | 400-600ms |
| **End-to-End Latency** | &lt;500ms | 500-800ms | 800-1200ms |
| **Network RTT** | &lt;50ms | 50-100ms | 100-200ms |

## Architecture Pattern

```
User Audio → WebSocket → STT (streaming) → LLM → TTS (streaming) → WebSocket → User
                ↑                                                        ↓
                └──────────── Bidirectional Connection ──────────────────┘
```

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Streaming Overview](/topics/infrastructure/streaming/overview) to understand the fundamentals, then dive into [WebSocket Protocols](/topics/infrastructure/streaming/websocket-protocols) for implementation details. For optimization, see [Latency Optimization](/topics/infrastructure/streaming/latency-optimization).
