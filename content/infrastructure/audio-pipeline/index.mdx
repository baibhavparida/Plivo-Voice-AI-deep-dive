# Audio Pipeline

The audio pipeline is the set of processing stages that audio passes through before reaching your speech recognition system. A well-designed audio pipeline ensures clean, clear audio that maximizes transcription accuracy and user experience.

## Why Audio Pipeline Matters

Raw audio from microphones or phone calls often contains:

- **Background noise**: Traffic, HVAC, crowd noise
- **Echo**: Speaker audio feeding back into the microphone
- **Inconsistent levels**: Volume variations between speakers
- **Codec artifacts**: Compression distortion from telephony

The audio pipeline addresses these issues before speech recognition.

## Topics in This Section

### [Signal Processing](/topics/infrastructure/audio-pipeline/signal-processing)
Digital signal processing fundamentals for audio, including sampling, encoding, filtering, and format conversion.

### [Noise Cancellation](/topics/infrastructure/audio-pipeline/noise-cancellation)
Techniques for removing background noise and improving audio clarity. From spectral subtraction to neural noise suppression.

### [Echo Cancellation](/topics/infrastructure/audio-pipeline/echo-cancellation)
Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) for full-duplex voice communication. Prevent the AI's own voice from being picked up.

### [Voice Activity Detection](/topics/infrastructure/audio-pipeline/vad)
Detecting speech presence and managing turn-taking in conversations. Essential for knowing when to listen and when to speak.

## Typical Audio Pipeline

```
Microphone/Phone → Codec Decode → Noise Cancellation → Echo Cancellation → VAD → STT
```

Each stage prepares the audio for the next:

| Stage | Purpose | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Codec Decode** | Convert compressed audio to PCM | Baseline quality |
| **Noise Cancellation** | Remove background sounds | Improved WER |
| **Echo Cancellation** | Remove speaker feedback | Enable interruption |
| **VAD** | Detect speech boundaries | Proper endpointing |

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Good | Acceptable | Poor |
|--------|------|------------|------|
| **SNR (Signal-to-Noise)** | >20dB | 10-20dB | &lt;10dB |
| **Processing Latency** | &lt;20ms | 20-50ms | >50ms |
| **Echo Return Loss** | >40dB | 30-40dB | &lt;30dB |

## Getting Started

Begin with [Signal Processing](/topics/infrastructure/audio-pipeline/signal-processing) to understand audio fundamentals, then explore [Noise Cancellation](/topics/infrastructure/audio-pipeline/noise-cancellation) and [Echo Cancellation](/topics/infrastructure/audio-pipeline/echo-cancellation) for audio enhancement techniques.
