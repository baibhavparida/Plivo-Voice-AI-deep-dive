# Language Understanding (NLU)

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is the technology that interprets the meaning behind user speech. While speech recognition converts audio to text, NLU extracts the intent, entities, and semantic meaning from that text.

## Why Language Understanding Matters

NLU bridges the gap between raw transcription and actionable understanding:

- **Intent Classification**: Understanding what the user wants to accomplish
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifying key information like names, dates, and amounts
- **Context Awareness**: Maintaining understanding across conversation turns
- **Sentiment Detection**: Recognizing user emotions and satisfaction levels

## Topics in This Section

### [Intent Recognition](/topics/foundations/language-understanding/intent-recognition)
Techniques for classifying user intentions from natural language input. From rule-based systems to modern LLM-powered approaches.

### [Entity Extraction](/topics/foundations/language-understanding/entity-extraction)
Named entity recognition and slot filling for extracting structured data from user utterances. Identify names, dates, locations, and custom entities.

### [Dialogue State](/topics/foundations/language-understanding/dialogue-state)
Managing conversation context and tracking dialogue state across multiple turns. Essential for multi-turn conversations.

### [Sentiment Analysis](/topics/foundations/language-understanding/sentiment-analysis)
Detecting emotional tone, sentiment, and user satisfaction from speech and text. Use voice cues and language patterns to understand user feelings.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Intent** | The goal or action a user wants to accomplish |
| **Entity/Slot** | Specific pieces of information within an utterance |
| **Dialogue State** | The current context and collected information in a conversation |
| **Confidence Score** | How certain the system is about its interpretation |
| **Fallback Handling** | Managing cases where intent cannot be determined |

## Modern Approaches

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), NLU approaches have evolved:

- **Traditional NLU**: Dedicated intent classifiers and entity extractors
- **LLM-Powered NLU**: Using models like GPT-4 or Claude for understanding
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining rule-based logic with LLM flexibility

## Getting Started

Begin with [Intent Recognition](/topics/foundations/language-understanding/intent-recognition) to understand how voice AI systems classify user goals, then explore [Entity Extraction](/topics/foundations/language-understanding/entity-extraction) to learn how to capture specific information from conversations.
