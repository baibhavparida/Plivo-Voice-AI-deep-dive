# Speech Synthesis (TTS)

Speech Synthesis, commonly known as Text-to-Speech (TTS), is the technology that converts written text into spoken audio. In voice AI systems, TTS serves as the "voice" that allows your AI to speak naturally to users.

## Why Speech Synthesis Matters

TTS is the final step in most voice AI pipelines, and its quality directly impacts:

- **User Perception**: A natural-sounding voice builds trust and engagement
- **Brand Identity**: Your AI's voice becomes part of your brand
- **Accessibility**: High-quality TTS enables voice interfaces for all users
- **Latency**: Time-to-first-audio affects perceived responsiveness

## Topics in This Section

### [TTS Overview](/topics/foundations/speech-synthesis/overview)
Introduction to speech synthesis technology, from early concatenative systems to modern neural approaches. Understand how TTS has evolved.

### [Neural TTS](/topics/foundations/speech-synthesis/neural-tts)
Deep dive into neural text-to-speech architectures including Tacotron, WaveNet, and VITS. Learn how these models achieve human-like speech.

### [Voice Cloning](/topics/foundations/speech-synthesis/voice-cloning)
Technologies and ethical considerations of voice cloning, speaker adaptation, and creating custom voices for your applications.

### [SSML](/topics/foundations/speech-synthesis/ssml)
Speech Synthesis Markup Language for fine-grained control over pronunciation, prosody, pauses, and other speech characteristics.

### [Provider Comparison](/topics/foundations/speech-synthesis/provider-comparison)
Comprehensive comparison of TTS providers including ElevenLabs, Google, AWS Polly, Azure, and others. Voice quality, latency, and pricing.

### [TTS Optimization](/topics/foundations/speech-synthesis/optimization)
Techniques for optimizing speech synthesis quality, reducing latency, and improving naturalness in production systems.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)** | Subjective measure of voice quality (1-5 scale) |
| **Time-to-First-Audio (TTFA)** | Latency before speech starts playing |
| **Prosody** | Rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech |
| **Voice Cloning** | Creating synthetic voices from audio samples |
| **Streaming TTS** | Generating and playing audio in real-time |
