# Speech Recognition (STT)

Speech Recognition, also known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Speech-to-Text (STT), is the technology that converts spoken language into written text. It's a foundational component of any voice AI system, serving as the "ears" that allow machines to understand human speech.

## Why Speech Recognition Matters

In voice AI applications, STT is typically the first step in the processing pipeline. The accuracy and speed of your speech recognition directly impacts:

- **User Experience**: Users expect their words to be understood correctly
- **Downstream Processing**: Errors in transcription propagate through the entire system
- **Latency**: STT processing time contributes to overall response delay
- **Cost**: Different providers have varying pricing models

## Topics in This Section

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Word Error Rate (WER)** | Primary metric for measuring transcription accuracy |
| **Real-time Factor (RTF)** | Processing time relative to audio duration |
| **Streaming ASR** | Processing audio in real-time as it's spoken |
| **Batch ASR** | Processing complete audio files after recording |
| **Endpointing** | Detecting when a speaker has finished talking |

## Getting Started
